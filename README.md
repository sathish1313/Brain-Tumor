# Brain-Tumor
Brain tumors represent a significant challenge in the medical field due to their diverse types and complex presentation. Accurate and timely detection of brain tumors is crucial for effective treatment planning and improving patient prognosis. Traditionally, brain tumor diagnosis relies on manual interpretation of MRI scans by radiologists, which can be time-consuming and prone to variability. To address these challenges, there is a growing interest in leveraging advanced computational techniques for automated and accurate tumor detection and classification. Recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in medical imaging analysis. Among these techniques, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a specialized type of recurrent neural network, have demonstrated significant potential in handling sequential data and learning long-range dependencies.
